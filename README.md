# SYSIGHT
Sysight is a web application that aims to centralize information from temperature measurement from manual meters. The idea arose in the context of the covid-19 pandemic and came to facilitate companies' control of their corporate environment.

With dashboards, login/registration system and an institutional page, we simply seek to improve the user experience.

This project has a 100% academic purpose.
